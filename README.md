Simple example node.js chatserver
=================================

This is a personal attempt to get to know more about node.js. So it's nowhere near ready or bugfree.

Heroku
------

Doesn't support socket.io so went to nodejistsu

NodeJitsu
---------

Add env variable

  % jitsu env set NODE_ENV production
